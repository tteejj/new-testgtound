# TUI FIXES - RENDER AND NAVIGATION ISSUES

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dashboard Navigation Loss After Returning from Other Screens
**Problem**: Arrow key navigation stopped working when returning to the dashboard from other screens.
**Root Cause**: The `OnResume` lifecycle hook didn't restore focus to any component, and the focused component name wasn't being properly managed.
**Fix**: Enhanced the `OnResume` method in `dashboard-screen-grid.psm1` to:
- Restore focus to the first focusable component (quickActions) if no component was previously focused
- Ensure all components know their focus state
- Request a UI refresh after restoring focus

### 2. Unicode Character Rendering Issues
**Problem**: Wide Unicode characters (CJK, emojis) caused alignment issues in the UI.
**Root Cause**: The `Write-BufferString` function incremented X position by 1 for all characters regardless of display width.
**Fix**: Updated `Write-BufferString` in `tui-engine-v2.psm1` to:
- Detect wide characters using a Unicode range regex
- Increment X position by 2 for wide characters
- Fill the second cell with a space to prevent overlap

### 3. Date/Time Picker Render Errors
**Problem**: Date and time picker components could render outside buffer bounds.
**Root Cause**: No bounds checking for displayed text or icon positions.
**Fix**: Updated both `New-TuiDatePicker` and `New-TuiTimePicker` in `tui-components.psm1` to:
- Truncate displayed text if it exceeds available width
- Only render icons if there's enough space
- Add proper bounds checking before rendering

### 4. Missing Timer Start Screen
**Problem**: Dashboard referenced a timer start screen that didn't exist.
**Root Cause**: Screen module was not implemented.
**Fix**: Created `timer-start-screen.psm1` with:
- Complete timer start/stop functionality
- Project selection
- Time tracking
- Integration with the data manager

### 5. Dashboard Fallback Navigation
**Problem**: Arrow keys didn't work when DataTable components weren't available.
**Root Cause**: No fallback navigation handling.
**Fix**: Enhanced dashboard `HandleInput` to:
- Detect when DataTable components aren't available
- Provide basic arrow key navigation in fallback mode
- Ensure number key shortcuts always work

## Files Modified

1. **screens/dashboard-screen-grid.psm1**
   - Enhanced `OnResume` method for focus restoration
   - Improved `HandleInput` with fallback navigation

2. **modules/tui-engine-v2.psm1**
   - Fixed `Write-BufferString` Unicode handling

3. **components/tui-components.psm1**
   - Fixed `New-TuiDatePicker` render bounds
   - Fixed `New-TuiTimePicker` render bounds

4. **screens/timer-start-screen.psm1** (new file)
   - Complete timer management screen

5. **main.ps1**
   - Added timer-start-screen to module load list

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Navigation Test**:
   - Start the app and navigate to different screens using number keys
   - Return to dashboard using Escape
   - Verify arrow keys and Tab still work on dashboard

2. **Unicode Test**:
   - Create entries with Unicode characters (emoji, CJK text)
   - Verify UI alignment remains correct

3. **Date/Time Picker Test**:
   - Navigate to time entry screen
   - Test date picker navigation
   - Verify no render errors occur

4. **Timer Test**:
   - Press 2 from dashboard to start timer
   - Test timer start/stop functionality
   - Verify time entries are created correctly

## Future Improvements

1. Implement clipboard support (Ctrl+V) for text inputs
2. Add more robust focus management system
3. Implement proper Unicode width detection library
4. Add screen transition animations
5. Implement component validation framework
