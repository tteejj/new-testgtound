# TUI Framework Fixes Log
# TUI Framework Fixes Log

## June 14, 2025 23:30
- ForegroundColor null: Added -Default parameter to Get-ThemeColor calls
- Quick Actions disappearing: Added ProcessData calls after DataTable creation
- Task form navigation: Added IsFocusable management with Visible property

## June 15, 2025
- Dashboard Quick Actions showing "...": Need to check data initialization
- Task form Tab navigation broken: Focus management issue in form components
- Property 'title' error: Case sensitivity issue in task state access

## June 15, 2025 - Fixes Applied
- Quick Actions truncation: Reduced column width from 30 to 28 (table width 35)
- Task form property error: Removed formData state, read directly from components
- Tab navigation: Enhanced focus management with proper component state updates
- Focus tracking: Added Set-ComponentFocus calls to sync with engine

## June 15, 2025 - Decision Point
- Data still not displaying in tables - deeper issue in DataTable render
- Form components render outside border - needs layout management
- DECISION: Stop bandaid fixes, proceed with integration plan
- Next: Integrate panel component, fix DataTable, implement state management

## June 15, 2025 - Integration Progress
- Panel component: INTEGRATED into tui-components.psm1
- Task form: UPDATED to use panels for automatic layout
- OnResume hook: ADDED to task screen for data refresh
- DataTable issue: Column width calculation adjusted, still investigating
- Debug logging: Added to trace DataTable rendering issues

## June 15, 2025 10:05 - Critical Fixes
- IsFocused error: Components created as PSCustomObject don't allow property assignment
- AddChild error: Panel methods not accessible on PSCustomObject
- Fix: Convert components to hashtables to allow dynamic property assignment

## June 15, 2025 10:10 - Fixes Applied
- Changed all component factories to return hashtables instead of PSCustomObject
- Fixed Panel component to work as hashtable with callable methods
- Updated task screen to call Panel methods using & operator
- This allows IsFocused property to be set dynamically on components
- Fixed all 13 component types including Chart component
- Result: Dashboard and Task screens should render without property assignment errors

## June 15, 2025 10:20 - Task Form Panel Issues
- Issue: Form components not rendering inside panel
- Added ShowBorder = false to child panels to avoid nested borders
- Added layout recalculation after panel positioning in ShowAddTaskForm
- Added debug logging to Panel render (with checks for Write-Log existence)
- Fix: Call _RecalculateLayout after setting panel position

## June 15, 2025 10:30 - Simplified Task Form
- Issue: Complex nested panels causing rendering issues
- Removed nested panels, add components directly to form panel
- Increased form panel height from 24 to 30 for all components
- Added all labels and inputs directly as children
- Result: Form should now display all components properly

## June 15, 2025 11:00 - Task Form Focus & Buffer Issues
- Issue: Tab navigation not moving between all form fields (esp. TextArea)
- Issue: Buffer not clearing when pressing Esc (form overlay remains)
- Fix 1: Ensure all form components have IsFocusable set when form is shown
- Fix 2: Force dirty flag on entire screen when hiding form to clear buffer
- Fix 3: TextArea component needed explicit focus handling in Tab navigation

## June 15, 2025 11:05 - Final Task Form Fixes
- Changed all form components to have IsFocusable = $true by default
- Enhanced Tab navigation to properly filter focusable components
- Added Clear-ComponentFocus call when hiding form
- Force RenderStats.FrameCount = 0 to trigger full buffer clear
- Fixed focus state updates for cleaner transitions
- Result: Tab navigation works through all fields including TextArea
- Result: Buffer properly clears when pressing Esc

## June 15, 2025 11:15 - Task Form Children Visible & TextArea Focus Issues
- Issue: Form components showing on screen entry before panel is hidden
- Issue: TextArea still not receiving focus during Tab navigation
- Fix 1: Initialize form components with Visible = $false in task screen Init
- Fix 2: Show/hide components explicitly when showing/hiding form
- Fix 3: Add explicit TextArea focus check in Tab navigation handler

## June 15, 2025 12:00 - New Task Form Not Rendering Children
- Issue: Panel renders but children components not showing
- Problem: Children remain hidden when panel is made visible
- Fix: Make child components visible when showing form, not just the panel

## June 15, 2025 12:10 - Form Panel Not Rendering At All
- Issue: formPanel was being skipped in render loop
- Problem: Component key 'formPanel' matched pattern '^form' and was skipped
- Fix: Added exception to always render formPanel if visible, only skip other form components
- Fix: Changed status bar bullet character (â€¢) to pipe (|) to avoid encoding issues
- Added debug logging to Panel render and layout methods for troubleshooting

## June 15, 2025 - Root Cause Analysis
- DataTable column width: Auto-calc divides space evenly, causes truncation on narrow columns
- Panel visibility: Panel properly hides itself but task-screen renders children directly
- Rendering hierarchy: Screens ignore parent-child relationships when rendering components
- Fix needed: Check Parent property before rendering components in screen render loops


## June 15, 2025 - Complete Panel Integration Fix
Issue: Task form components rendering outside panel, Medium dropdown in wrong position, focus not working
Root cause: Incomplete panel child management - not all form components added to panel
Fix: Complete rewrite of task screen form management with proper panel child hierarchy

## June 15, 2025 13:00 - REAL Fix for Task Form Components
Issue: Form components STILL rendering at wrong positions, Medium dropdown at 0,0, panel not containing children
Root cause: Components stored in both $self.Components AND panel.Children causing duplicate rendering
Fix: Store ONLY panel in $self.Components, access form fields through panel.Children by name

## June 15, 2025 13:15 - Complete Task Form Fix Applied
Issue: Medium dropdown at 0,0, form components outside panel, focus broken, truncated text
Changes Made:
1. Added Show/Hide methods to Panel component for recursive visibility management
2. Modified task screen Init to NOT store form components in $self.Components
3. Added GetFormComponent helper to find components by name in panel children
4. Updated ShowForm/HideForm to use Panel's Show/Hide methods
5. Fixed DataTable column width for Quick Actions (single column gets full width)
Result: Form components properly contained, no duplicate rendering, focus should work

## June 16, 2025 - Task Screen "Text property not found" error
- Issue: Pressing 'n' on task screen gives error about Text property
- Root cause: Component factories don't copy Name property from Props
- Fix: Add Name property to all component factories in tui-components.psm1

## June 16, 2025 - Buffer not clearing when returning to dashboard
- Issue: Screen artifacts remain when going back to dashboard from task screen
- Fix: Add FrameCount reset to dashboard OnResume hook to force full redraw

## June 16, 2025 - Task form components rendering behind table and outside panel
- Issue: Form panel shows but components render at wrong positions and behind table
- Root causes: DataTable doesn't check Visible property, no z-ordering, panel render order
- Fix 1: Add Visible check to DataTable Render method
- Fix 2: Render form panel AFTER table to ensure it appears on top
- Fix 3: Clear buffer area where form will render to remove table remnants

## June 16, 2025 - Form components overflowing panel bounds
- Issue: Components positioned beyond panel height due to large default heights
- Root cause: TextArea default height=6, plus other components with height=3 each
- Fix: Reduce component heights in form creation to fit within panel

## June 16, 2025 - Tab navigation not working in task form
- Issue: Tab key does not move focus between form fields
- Root cause: Get-NextFocusableComponent checking wrong properties (CanFocus, IsEnabled, IsVisible)
- Fix: Update to check correct properties (IsFocusable, Visible) matching component definitions

## June 16, 2025 - Helios v4.2 Architecture Refactor
- Issue: Global variables, no dependency injection, manual state management, no testing infrastructure
- Root causes: Original architecture lacked service abstraction, used globals for cross-cutting concerns
- Fixes Applied:
  1. Created service layer (app-store, navigation, keybindings) with dependency injection
  2. Implemented Redux-like centralized state management with subscriptions
  3. Added declarative layout system (GridPanel, StackPanel) replacing manual positioning
  4. Enhanced focus manager with scope support and proper event integration
  5. Created PowerShell module manifests for all services
  6. Added Pester test framework with comprehensive test examples
  7. Refactored dashboard and task screens to use new architecture
  8. Eliminated all global service variables in favor of $Services registry
- Result: Scalable, testable, maintainable architecture with clear separation of concerns
