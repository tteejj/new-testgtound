# Dashboard and Task Screen Fixes - June 14, 2025 23:30

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ForegroundColor Null Error
**Problem**: Get-ThemeColor was returning null for missing color keys, causing "Cannot convert null to type System.ConsoleColor" errors.
**Fix**: Added -Default parameter to all Get-ThemeColor calls in advanced-data-components.psm1 with appropriate fallback colors.

### 2. Quick Actions List Disappearing
**Problem**: DataTable components weren't properly processing their data for display.
**Fix**: 
- Added explicit ProcessData calls after creating DataTable components in dashboard Init
- Added ProcessData calls in RefreshData when updating component data
- This ensures ProcessedData array is populated for rendering

### 3. Task Form Navigation Issues
**Problem**: Form components weren't properly managing visibility and focusability states.
**Fix**:
- Added IsFocusable property management alongside Visible property changes
- Set IsFocusable = false when components are hidden, true when shown
- Set initial IsFocusable = false for all form components on creation

### 4. Minor Fixes
- Fixed missing variable reference ($borderColor) in DataTable header separator
- Added -Default parameter to Get-ThemeColor calls in dashboard render method
- Added null checks when accessing component properties
