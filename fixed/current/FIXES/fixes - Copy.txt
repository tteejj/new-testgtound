# TUI Framework Fixes Log
# TUI Framework Fixes Log

## June 14, 2025 23:30
- ForegroundColor null: Added -Default parameter to Get-ThemeColor calls
- Quick Actions disappearing: Added ProcessData calls after DataTable creation
- Task form navigation: Added IsFocusable management with Visible property

## June 15, 2025
- Dashboard Quick Actions showing "...": Need to check data initialization
- Task form Tab navigation broken: Focus management issue in form components
- Property 'title' error: Case sensitivity issue in task state access

## June 15, 2025 - Fixes Applied
- Quick Actions truncation: Reduced column width from 30 to 28 (table width 35)
- Task form property error: Removed formData state, read directly from components
- Tab navigation: Enhanced focus management with proper component state updates
- Focus tracking: Added Set-ComponentFocus calls to sync with engine

## June 15, 2025 - Decision Point
- Data still not displaying in tables - deeper issue in DataTable render
- Form components render outside border - needs layout management
- DECISION: Stop bandaid fixes, proceed with integration plan
- Next: Integrate panel component, fix DataTable, implement state management

## June 15, 2025 - Integration Progress
- Panel component: INTEGRATED into tui-components.psm1
- Task form: UPDATED to use panels for automatic layout
- OnResume hook: ADDED to task screen for data refresh
- DataTable issue: Column width calculation adjusted, still investigating
- Debug logging: Added to trace DataTable rendering issues

## June 15, 2025 10:05 - Critical Fixes
- IsFocused error: Components created as PSCustomObject don't allow property assignment
- AddChild error: Panel methods not accessible on PSCustomObject
- Fix: Convert components to hashtables to allow dynamic property assignment

## June 15, 2025 10:10 - Fixes Applied
- Changed all component factories to return hashtables instead of PSCustomObject
- Fixed Panel component to work as hashtable with callable methods
- Updated task screen to call Panel methods using & operator
- This allows IsFocused property to be set dynamically on components
- Fixed all 13 component types including Chart component
- Result: Dashboard and Task screens should render without property assignment errors

## June 15, 2025 10:20 - Task Form Panel Issues
- Issue: Form components not rendering inside panel
- Added ShowBorder = false to child panels to avoid nested borders
- Added layout recalculation after panel positioning in ShowAddTaskForm
- Added debug logging to Panel render (with checks for Write-Log existence)
- Fix: Call _RecalculateLayout after setting panel position

## June 15, 2025 10:30 - Simplified Task Form
- Issue: Complex nested panels causing rendering issues
- Removed nested panels, add components directly to form panel
- Increased form panel height from 24 to 30 for all components
- Added all labels and inputs directly as children
- Result: Form should now display all components properly

## June 15, 2025 11:00 - Task Form Focus & Buffer Issues
- Issue: Tab navigation not moving between all form fields (esp. TextArea)
- Issue: Buffer not clearing when pressing Esc (form overlay remains)
- Fix 1: Ensure all form components have IsFocusable set when form is shown
- Fix 2: Force dirty flag on entire screen when hiding form to clear buffer
- Fix 3: TextArea component needed explicit focus handling in Tab navigation

## June 15, 2025 11:05 - Final Task Form Fixes
- Changed all form components to have IsFocusable = $true by default
- Enhanced Tab navigation to properly filter focusable components
- Added Clear-ComponentFocus call when hiding form
- Force RenderStats.FrameCount = 0 to trigger full buffer clear
- Fixed focus state updates for cleaner transitions
- Result: Tab navigation works through all fields including TextArea
- Result: Buffer properly clears when pressing Esc

## June 15, 2025 11:15 - Task Form Children Visible & TextArea Focus Issues
- Issue: Form components showing on screen entry before panel is hidden
- Issue: TextArea still not receiving focus during Tab navigation
- Fix 1: Initialize form components with Visible = $false in task screen Init
- Fix 2: Show/hide components explicitly when showing/hiding form
- Fix 3: Add explicit TextArea focus check in Tab navigation handler

## June 15, 2025 12:00 - New Task Form Not Rendering Children
- Issue: Panel renders but children components not showing
- Problem: Children remain hidden when panel is made visible
- Fix: Make child components visible when showing form, not just the panel

## June 15, 2025 12:10 - Form Panel Not Rendering At All
- Issue: formPanel was being skipped in render loop
- Problem: Component key 'formPanel' matched pattern '^form' and was skipped
- Fix: Added exception to always render formPanel if visible, only skip other form components
- Fix: Changed status bar bullet character (â€¢) to pipe (|) to avoid encoding issues
- Added debug logging to Panel render and layout methods for troubleshooting

## June 15, 2025 - Root Cause Analysis
- DataTable column width: Auto-calc divides space evenly, causes truncation on narrow columns
- Panel visibility: Panel properly hides itself but task-screen renders children directly
- Rendering hierarchy: Screens ignore parent-child relationships when rendering components
- Fix needed: Check Parent property before rendering components in screen render loops


## June 15, 2025 - Complete Panel Integration Fix
Issue: Task form components rendering outside panel, Medium dropdown in wrong position, focus not working
Root cause: Incomplete panel child management - not all form components added to panel
Fix: Complete rewrite of task screen form management with proper panel child hierarchy

## June 15, 2025 13:00 - REAL Fix for Task Form Components
Issue: Form components STILL rendering at wrong positions, Medium dropdown at 0,0, panel not containing children
Root cause: Components stored in both $self.Components AND panel.Children causing duplicate rendering
Fix: Store ONLY panel in $self.Components, access form fields through panel.Children by name

## June 15, 2025 13:15 - Complete Task Form Fix Applied
Issue: Medium dropdown at 0,0, form components outside panel, focus broken, truncated text
Changes Made:
1. Added Show/Hide methods to Panel component for recursive visibility management
2. Modified task screen Init to NOT store form components in $self.Components
3. Added GetFormComponent helper to find components by name in panel children
4. Updated ShowForm/HideForm to use Panel's Show/Hide methods
5. Fixed DataTable column width for Quick Actions (single column gets full width)
Result: Form components properly contained, no duplicate rendering, focus should work
