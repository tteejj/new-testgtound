# PMC Terminal - Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. RenderFormField Method Error
**Problem:** The time-entry-screen.psm1 was calling helper methods (RenderFormField, RenderTextInput, RenderButton) as if they were methods on the hashtable object, causing:
```
Method invocation failed because [System.Collections.Hashtable] does not contain a method named 'RenderFormField'
```

**Fix:** Changed all calls from `$self.MethodName()` to `& $self.MethodName` which properly invokes the scriptblock stored in the hashtable property.

### 2. Screen Not Clearing Properly
**Problem:** The screen was showing overlapping text from previous renders and initialization messages were bleeding through, making the display unreadable.

**Fix:** 
- Modified `Clear-BackBuffer` to create a new cell object for each position instead of reusing the same reference
- Added cursor positioning to move cursor out of the way after rendering
- Removed debug messages that were printing to console
- Added silent mode (`-silent` flag) to suppress initialization messages
- Added Clear-Host before starting TUI loop
- Implemented force full render on first frame to clear any residual text
- Ensured complete buffer clearing on each frame

### 3. Missing Helper Functions
**Problem:** The time-entry screen referenced functions that weren't defined.

**Fix:** Added:
- `Get-ProjectOrTemplate` function with fallback behavior
- Proper error handling for optional dialog system calls

## Files Modified

1. **screens/time-entry-screen.psm1**
   - Fixed all scriptblock invocations (& operator)
   - Added helper function for project retrieval
   - Added fallback behavior for missing components

2. **modules/tui-engine-v2.psm1**
   - Fixed Clear-BackBuffer to properly clear screen
   - Added cursor positioning after render
   - Improved buffer management

3. **test-fixed-issues.ps1** (new)
   - Created test script to verify fixes

## Testing

To test the fixes:

**Option 1 - Run in Silent Mode (Recommended):**
```powershell
.\run-silent.ps1
```

**Option 2 - Run with verbose output:**
```powershell
.\test-fixed-issues.ps1
```

**Option 3 - Run directly with silent flag:**
```powershell
.\main.ps1 -silent
```

This will:
1. Load the PMC Terminal with fixes
2. Allow navigation to Time Entry screen (option 1)
3. Verify RenderFormField error is resolved
4. Confirm screen clearing works properly without text bleed-through

## Key Changes Summary

1. **Scriptblock Invocation**: `$self.Method()` → `& $self.Method`
2. **Buffer Clearing**: Reused cell reference → New cell per position
3. **Error Handling**: Added fallbacks for missing functions
4. **Cursor Management**: Added cursor positioning to avoid interference
5. **Debug Output**: Removed debug Write-Host statements from TUI engine
6. **Silent Mode**: Added `-silent` flag to suppress initialization messages
7. **Console Clearing**: Added Clear-Host before TUI loop starts
8. **Full Render**: Force complete screen render on first frame
