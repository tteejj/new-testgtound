# Phase 2.3 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 2.3 focused on unifying and standardizing component creation & layouts throughout the TUI framework. This phase makes the framework more consistent, maintainable, and powerful by implementing proper layout managers.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Added Layout System to tui-framework.psm1
- **Apply-Layout** function: Main entry point for layout algorithms
- **Apply-StackLayout**: Implements vertical/horizontal stacking with spacing
- **Apply-GridLayout**: Implements grid-based layouts with rows, columns, and cell spanning

### 2. Created Container Component (tui-components.psm1)
- New **New-TuiContainer** function
- Supports Layout property (Stack, Grid, Manual)
- Automatically applies layout to children during render
- Properly delegates input handling to focusable children

### 3. Refactored Create-TuiForm
- Now uses Stack layout instead of hardcoded coordinates
- Each field row is a Container with horizontal Stack layout
- Form itself uses vertical Stack layout
- Button container uses horizontal Stack layout
- Dynamic positioning based on field count

### 4. Created Grid-Based Dashboard (dashboard-screen-grid.psm1)
- Uses Grid layout with 3 columns × 3 rows
- Containers for each section (QuickActions, Stats, Timers, etc.)
- Cell spanning for wider bottom sections
- No manual coordinate calculations

### 5. Framework Component Registry
- Added Container to the component registry
- Create-TuiScreen already uses Create-TuiComponent factory

## Key Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All components now use the same layout system
2. **Maintainability**: No more hardcoded coordinates scattered throughout
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to change layouts without recalculating positions
4. **Responsive**: Layouts can adapt to different screen sizes
5. **Declarative**: Define structure, let the framework handle positioning

## Usage Examples

### Stack Layout (Vertical)
```powershell
$screen = Create-TuiScreen -Definition @{
    Layout = "Stack"
    LayoutOptions = @{
        Orientation = "Vertical"
        Spacing = 2
        Padding = 3
    }
    Children = @(
        @{ Name = "Title"; Type = "Label"; Props = @{ Text = "My App" } }
        @{ Name = "Input"; Type = "TextBox"; Props = @{ } }
        @{ Name = "Submit"; Type = "Button"; Props = @{ Text = "OK" } }
    )
}
```

### Grid Layout
```powershell
$screen = Create-TuiScreen -Definition @{
    Layout = "Grid"
    LayoutOptions = @{
        Rows = 2
        Columns = 3
        Spacing = 1
    }
    Children = @(
        # Components automatically positioned in grid cells
        @{ Name = "Cell1"; Type = "Label"; Props = @{ Text = "1" } }
        @{ Name = "Cell2"; Type = "Label"; Props = @{ Text = "2"; ColSpan = 2 } }
        # etc...
    )
}
```

### Form with Automatic Layout
```powershell
$form = Create-TuiForm -Title "Settings" -Fields @(
    @{ Name = "Username"; Label = "Username"; Type = "TextBox" }
    @{ Name = "Theme"; Label = "Theme"; Type = "Dropdown"; Options = $themes }
) -OnSubmit { param($FormData) Save-Settings $FormData }
```

## Testing
Run `.\test-phase2-layouts.ps1` to see demonstrations of the new layout system.

## Next Steps
With Phase 2.3 complete, the framework now has:
- ✓ Proper layout management
- ✓ Consistent component creation
- ✓ Declarative UI structure

This sets a solid foundation for Phase 3 (Architectural Purity) and Phase 4 (Advanced Features).
