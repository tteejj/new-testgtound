# PMC Terminal v3.0 Migration Status

## What's Been Done

### âœ… Core Framework Migration
1. **TUI Engine v2** - Fixed Pop-Screen logic bug identified in critique
2. **Event System** - Fully implemented with publish/subscribe pattern
3. **Component Library** - All core components implemented:
   - TextBox (with cursor support)
   - Button
   - Label
   - Dropdown (NEW - was missing)
   - CheckBox
   - ProgressBar
   - Form Container (fixed to be created once in Init)

### âœ… Data Layer
- Complete data-manager.psm1 with:
  - JSON persistence
  - Event-driven CRUD operations
  - Project/Task/TimeEntry management
  - Settings storage

### âœ… Screens Implemented
1. **Dashboard** - Main menu with stats display
2. **Time Tracking Menu** - Submenu for time operations
3. **Time Entry Form** - Fixed to use persistent form container
4. **Timer Start Screen** - For starting work timers
5. **Placeholder screens** for other menu items

### âœ… Key Fixes Applied
1. **Form Container Issue** - Forms are now created once in Init, not recreated on every render
2. **Pop-Screen Logic** - OnExit is called on the correct screen
3. **Module Loading** - Uses Import-Module instead of dot sourcing
4. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error logging

## Running the Application

1. **Test the system first:**
   ```powershell
   .\test-system.ps1
   ```

2. **Apply any needed fixes:**
   ```powershell
   .\apply-fixes.ps1
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```powershell
   .\main.ps1
   ```

## Navigation

- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate menus
- **Tab/Shift+Tab**: Move between form fields
- **Enter**: Select/Submit
- **Escape**: Go back/Cancel

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Get-DashboardScreen not recognized"
**Solution**: Already fixed - dashboard-screen.psm1 has been created

### Issue: Components missing Clone method
**Solution**: Run `.\apply-fixes.ps1` or manually ensure all components have Clone method

### Issue: Dropdown not working
**Solution**: Already fixed - New-TuiDropdown has been implemented

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: UI, Data, and Logic are completely decoupled
2. **Event-Driven**: Components communicate via events, not direct coupling
3. **Stateless Components**: All state lives in screens, components are pure
4. **Performance**: Forms created once, not on every render
5. **Maintainability**: Each screen is self-contained in its own file

## Next Steps

1. Implement remaining screens (Project, Task, Reports)
2. Add data visualization components
3. Implement keyboard shortcuts system
4. Add help overlay
5. Polish the UI with animations

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors:

1. Check error.log for details
2. Run test-system.ps1 to verify setup
3. Ensure PowerShell 5.0+ and ANSI support
4. Try running as Administrator if file access issues

The migration to TUI v2 is functionally complete for core features!
