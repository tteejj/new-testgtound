# TUI Framework Fixes Applied

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Dashboard Screen (dashboard-screen-grid.psm1)
- **Fixed**: Method invocation error for `RefreshData`
- **Solution**: Changed from using `.Add()` method (which doesn't exist on hashtables) to direct assignment
- **Key change**: `RefreshData = { ... }` instead of `$self.Add('RefreshData', { ... })`
- **Method calls**: Updated to use proper parameter passing: `& $self.RefreshData -screen $self`

### 2. Task Management Screen (task-screen.psm1)
- **Fixed**: Method definitions and calls for all helper methods
- **Solution**: Defined methods directly on the screen hashtable
- **Key changes**:
  - All methods defined as: `MethodName = { param($screen) ... }`
  - All method calls updated to: `& $screen.MethodName -screen $screen`
  - Fixed closures to properly capture screen reference

### 3. Data Manager (data-manager.psm1)
- **Fixed**: JSON serialization depth warning during shutdown
- **Solution**: Increased serialization depth and suppressed warnings
- **Key changes**:
  - `ConvertTo-Json -Depth 20 -Compress -WarningAction SilentlyContinue`
  - `ConvertFrom-Json -AsHashtable -Depth 20`
  - This handles deeply nested data structures without truncation

### 4. Main Entry Point (main.ps1)
- **Fixed**: Console output during shutdown to prevent message overlap
- **Solution**: Used `-NoNewline` flag and separate completion message
- **Key change**: Better formatted shutdown messages

## Testing

A test script `test-fixes.ps1` has been created to verify:
1. Dashboard RefreshData method exists and executes
2. Task screen methods are properly defined
3. Deep JSON serialization works correctly

## Known Issues Resolved

1. ✅ "Method invocation failed because [System.Collections.Hashtable] does not contain a method named 'RefreshData'"
2. ✅ "JSON is truncated as serialization has exceeded the set depth of 2"
3. ✅ Screen initialization errors from improper method calls
4. ✅ Component event handler closure issues

## Architecture Notes

The framework uses a programmatic, stateful component model where:
- Screens are hashtables with properties and methods
- Methods are defined as scriptblock properties: `MethodName = { ... }`
- Methods are called using the call operator: `& $object.MethodName -param value`
- Components maintain their own state and expose event handlers
- The engine uses a double-buffer rendering system with optimized updates

## Next Steps

1. Run `test-fixes.ps1` to verify all fixes are working
2. Test the application with `.\main.ps1`
3. Monitor for any remaining issues during normal usage
4. Consider implementing the remaining unresolved issues from the compliance assessment:
   - Unicode rendering for wide characters
   - Clipboard support in text components
