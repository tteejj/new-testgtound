# Fixes Applied to PMC Terminal v3.0

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Negative Width Error
**Problem**: "times ('-6') must be a non-negative value"
**Cause**: Console window too small causing negative dimensions in box drawing
**Fix**: 
- Added bounds checking in `Write-BufferBox` to ensure minimum dimensions
- Added minimum console size check (80x24) on startup
- Made dashboard screen more responsive to small windows

### 2. ✅ Pipeline Stopped Error
**Problem**: "Error during TUI cleanup: The pipeline has been stopped"
**Cause**: Trying to call EndInvoke on already stopped PowerShell runspace
**Fix**:
- Added try-catch blocks in `Stop-InputHandler`
- Check if AsyncResult is completed before calling EndInvoke
- Gracefully handle cleanup errors

### 3. ✅ Console Size Handling
**Problem**: Application would crash with small console windows
**Fix**:
- Added `Test-ConsoleSize` function to check before starting
- Clear error messages telling user exactly what to do
- Minimum size enforcement (80x24)

### 4. ✅ Clone Method Issue
**Problem**: Components missing proper Clone implementation
**Fix**:
- Implemented proper Clone method that correctly copies all properties
- Handles scriptblocks, arrays, and hashtables appropriately

### 5. ✅ Better Error Handling
**Improvements**:
- Created separate error.log file
- More user-friendly error messages
- Console size errors are now clearly explained

## New Files Added

1. **start.ps1** - Safe startup script that checks environment first
2. **run.bat** - Simple batch file for easy Windows launching
3. **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide

## How to Run Now

### Option 1: Safe Start (Recommended)
```powershell
.\start.ps1
```

### Option 2: Direct Run
```powershell
.\main.ps1
```

### Option 3: Windows Batch
Double-click `run.bat`

## Console Requirements

- **Minimum Size**: 80 columns x 24 rows
- **Recommended**: 120 columns x 30 rows
- **Best Experience**: Windows Terminal

## If You Still Get Errors

1. Resize your console window - make it bigger!
2. Use Windows Terminal if possible
3. Check TROUBLESHOOTING.md for solutions
4. Run `.\test-system.ps1` to verify setup

The application should now handle small console windows gracefully and provide clear guidance when the window is too small.
