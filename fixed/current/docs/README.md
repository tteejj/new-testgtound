## Quick Start Path

1. **First Time?** Start with [GETTING-STARTED.md](GETTING-STARTED.md)
2. **Need Details?** Read [TUI-FRAMEWORK-GUIDE.md](TUI-FRAMEWORK-GUIDE.md)
3. **While Coding:** Keep [TUI-QUICK-REFERENCE.md](TUI-QUICK-REFERENCE.md) open
4. **Learn Patterns:** Study [TUI-EXAMPLE-APPS.md](TUI-EXAMPLE-APPS.md)
5. **Contributing?** Check [ADDITIONAL-FIXES-NEEDED.md](ADDITIONAL-FIXES-NEEDED.md)

## Running the Hello World Example

There's a ready-to-run example in the parent directory:

```powershell
cd ..
.\hello-world-example.ps1
```

This demonstrates:
- Basic component usage
- User input handling
- State updates
- Event handling

## Key Concepts to Understand

1. **Everything is a Component** - Even screens are special components
2. **State Drives UI** - Components react to state changes
3. **Events Connect Components** - Loose coupling through events
4. **Layouts Manage Position** - Use layout managers over absolute positioning
5. **Double Buffering** - Flicker-free rendering

## Framework Status

The framework is functional but has known issues:
- Performance optimizations needed (see TUI-ENGINE-FIXES.txt)
- Memory leaks in event system
- Focus management issues
- Missing clipboard support
- Some components not yet implemented

See [ADDITIONAL-FIXES-NEEDED.md](ADDITIONAL-FIXES-NEEDED.md) for details.

## Getting Help

1. Check the examples first
2. Search for similar patterns in existing screens
3. Verify your component IDs are unique
4. Remember to call `Request-TuiRefresh` after state changes
5. Use `-Force` when re-importing modules during development

Happy TUI Building! ðŸŽ¨
